# Number Guessing Game (or not)
For this assignment, create a simple app where the computer thinks of a number from 1 to 1000 and the user tries to guess it. The app should give the user hints to help them find the correct answer. In particular, your app should have the following functionality:
- A way for the user to input numerical guesses.
- A hinting system so that after each incorrect guess, the app tells the user whether the right answer is higher or lower than their guess.
- Logic where the game ends (stops asking for / accepting guesses) when the player guesses the right number.
- At game's end, a display to the player that they won, along with a count of the number of guesses that were needed to find the right answer.
- A way to start the game over and play again once the game has ended.
