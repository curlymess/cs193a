# Friendr
Program Description and Functionality Requirements:
For this assignment you will write an app named Friendr for finding and rating friends, where the interface is a lot like an "online dating" app such as Tinder, OKCupid, or Match. The app's name is a play on the idea of it being for "friends" + "Tinder", along with the fact that one of our data sets comes from the 1990s TV show, Friends. (You do not need to use the Friends data set nor name your app "Friendr" if you don't want to; we have some other data sets you can use instead, or you can make your own, as described later in this document.)

We would like you to write the following activity classes:
- FriendrMainActivity: An initial "welcome" screen with links to other activities.
- ViewUsersActivity: Displays all of the people available in the app.
- ProfileActivity: Displays details about an individual person and allows the user to rate them.
- SwipeActivity (optional): Allows the user to rate people by swiping left and right.
- SignUpActivity (optional): Allows the user to sign into the app and/or sign up for an account.
